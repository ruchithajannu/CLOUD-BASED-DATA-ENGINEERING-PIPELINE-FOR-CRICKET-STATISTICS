# CLOUD-BASED-DATA-ENGINEERING-PIPELINE-FOR-CRICKET-STATISTICS
A cloud-based data engineering pipeline for collecting, processing, and analyzing cricket statistics. It automates data ingestion, transformation, and storage on cloud platforms like AWS, enabling real-time analytics and visualization with scalability and cost-efficiency in mind. This repository implements a cloud-based data engineering pipeline that automates the collection, processing, and analysis of cricket statistics. The pipeline is designed to handle large-scale data, offering real-time insights and interactive visualizations.

Features:
Automated Data Ingestion: Collects cricket statistics via APIs, web scraping, or file uploads.
Data Transformation: Cleans and processes raw data into structured formats using Python and cloud-based ETL tools.
Cloud Storage: Stores processed data on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Real-Time Analytics: Uses serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for dynamic analysis and insights.
Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes cricket statistics using cloud-based BI tools (AWS QuickSight, Google Data Studio).

Technologies Used:
Cloud Platforms: AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2), Google Cloud (BigQuery, Cloud Functions)
Data Processing: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Apache Spark (optional)
Databases: SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
APIs: CricAPI or similar cricket data APIs
ETL Frameworks: Cloud-based ETL pipelines for data transformation
